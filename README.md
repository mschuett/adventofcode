# My Advent of Code

After seeing many [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) repositories I can upload my code as well. It is not polished or anything, only my own trial-and-error driven way to get through the puzzles.

## 2020

The first year I decided to set aside time and join the Advent of Code.

Written in Python 3. Some days got lost when copying between different laptops.

## 2021

For 2021 I chose Golang, because I have not used it for about 5 years now. I hope I remember a few things.

## 2015

I started the 2015 puzzles later as a way to write my very first Code in Kotlin.
